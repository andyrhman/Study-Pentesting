On the product pages, notice that the dangerous JavaScript extracts a storeId parameter from the location.search source.
It then uses document.write to create a new option in the select element for the stock checker functionality.
    
Add a storeId query parameter to the URL and enter a random alphanumeric string as its value. Request this modified URL.
    
In the browser, notice that your random string is now listed as one of the options in the drop-down list.
    
Right-click and inspect the drop-down list to confirm that the value of your storeId parameter has been placed inside a select element.

Change the URL to include a suitable XSS payload inside the storeId parameter as follows:
product?productId=1&storeId="></select><img%20src=1%20onerror=alert(1)>

Enter a random alphanumeric string into the search box.
    
View the page source and observe that your random string is enclosed in an ng-app directive.

Enter the following AngularJS expression in the search box:
{{$on.constructor('alert(1)')()}}
    
Click search.

In Burp Suite, go to the Proxy tool and make sure that the Intercept feature is switched on.
    
Back in the lab, go to the target website and use the search bar to search for a random test string, such as "XSS".
   
Return to the Proxy tool in Burp Suite and forward the request.
    
On the Intercept tab, notice that the string is reflected in a JSON response called search-results.
    
From the Site Map, open the searchResults.js file and notice that the JSON response is used with an eval() function call.
    
By experimenting with different search strings, you can identify that the JSON response is escaping quotation marks. However, backslash is not being escaped.

To solve this lab, enter the following search term:
\"-alert(1)}//

As you have injected a backslash and the site isn't escaping them, when the JSON response attempts to escape the opening double-quotes character, 
it adds a second backslash. The resulting double-backslash causes the escaping to be effectively canceled out. This means that the double-quotes 
are processed unescaped, which closes the string that should contain the search term.

An arithmetic operator (in this case the subtraction operator) is then used to separate the expressions before the alert() function is called. 
Finally, a closing curly bracket and two forward slashes close the JSON object early and comment out what would have been the rest of the object.
As a result, the response is generated as follows:
{"searchTerm":"\\"-alert(1)}//", "results":[]}

Post a comment containing the following vector:
<><img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>

In an attempt to prevent XSS, the website uses the JavaScript replace() function to encode angle brackets. 
However, when the first argument is a string, the function only replaces the first occurrence. We exploit this vulnerability by simply including 
an extra set of angle brackets at the beginning of the comment. These angle brackets will be encoded, but any subsequent angle brackets will be unaffected, 
enabling us to effectively bypass the filter and inject HTML.


    function escapeHTML(html) {
        return html.replace('<', '&lt;').replace('>', '&gt;');
    }
