Inject a standard XSS payload, such as:
<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
    
Observe that this payload gets blocked. In the next few steps, we'll use Burp Intruder to test which tags and attributes are being blocked.
    
Open Burp's browser and use the search function in the lab. Send the resulting request to Burp Intruder.
    
In Burp Intruder, in the Positions tab, click "Clear §".
    
In the request template, replace the value of the search term with: <>
    
Place the cursor between the angle brackets and click "Add §" twice to create a payload position. The value of the search term should now be: <§§>
    
Visit the XSS cheat sheet and click "Copy tags to clipboard".
    
In Burp Intruder, in the Payloads tab, click "Paste" to paste the list of tags into the payloads list. Click "Start attack".
    
When the attack is finished, review the results. Observe that all payloads caused an HTTP 400 response, except for the ones using the <svg>, 
	<animatetransform>, <title>, and <image> tags, which received a 200 response.

Go back to the Positions tab in Burp Intruder and replace your search term with:
    	<svg><animatetransform%20=1>

Place the cursor before the = character and click "Add §" twice to create a payload position. The value of the search term should now be:
    	<svg><animatetransform%20§§=1>
    
Visit the XSS cheat sheet and click "Copy events to clipboard".
    
In Burp Intruder, in the Payloads tab, click "Clear" to remove the previous payloads. Then click "Paste" to paste the list of attributes 
into the payloads list. Click "Start attack".

When the attack is finished, review the results. Note that all payloads caused an HTTP 400 response, except for the onbegin payload, which caused a 200 response.

Visit the following URL in the browser to confirm that the alert() function is called and the lab is solved:
https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?search=%22%3E%3Csvg%3E%3Canimatetransform%20onbegin=alert(1)%3E

########### https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-canonical-link-tag

Visit the following URL, replacing YOUR-LAB-ID with your lab ID:
https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?%27accesskey=%27x%27onclick=%27alert(1)

This sets the X key as an access key for the whole page. When a user presses the access key, the alert function is called.
    
To trigger the exploit on yourself, press one of the following key combinations:
        On Windows: ALT+SHIFT+X
        On MacOS: CTRL+ALT+X
        On Linux: Alt+X

Submit a random alphanumeric string in the search box, then use Burp Suite to intercept the search request and send it to Burp Repeater.
    
Observe that the random string has been reflected inside a JavaScript string.
    
Try sending the payload test'payload and observe that your single quote gets backslash-escaped, preventing you from breaking out of the string.

Replace your input with the following payload to break out of the script block and inject a new script:
</script><script>alert(1)</script>
   
Verify the technique worked by right clicking, selecting "Copy URL", and pasting the URL in the browser. When you load the page it should trigger an alert.

########### https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-javascript-string-angle-brackets-double-quotes-encoded-single-quotes-escaped

Submit a random alphanumeric string in the search box, then use Burp Suite to intercept the search request and send it to Burp Repeater.
    
Observe that the random string has been reflected inside a JavaScript string.
    
Try sending the payload test'payload and observe that your single quote gets backslash-escaped, preventing you from breaking out of the string.
    
Try sending the payload test\payload and observe that your backslash doesn't get escaped.

Replace your input with the following payload to break out of the JavaScript string and inject an alert:
    \'-alert(1)//
    
Verify the technique worked by right clicking, selecting "Copy URL", and pasting the URL in the browser. When you load the page it should trigger an alert.

########### !!! Stored XSS !!! https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-onclick-event-angle-brackets-double-quotes-html-encoded-single-quotes-backslash-escaped

Post a comment with a random alphanumeric string in the "Website" input, then use Burp Suite to intercept the request and send it to Burp Repeater.
    
Make a second request in the browser to view the post and use Burp Suite to intercept the request and send it to Burp Repeater.
    
Observe that the random string in the second Repeater tab has been reflected inside an onclick event handler attribute.

Repeat the process again but this time modify your input to inject a JavaScript URL that calls alert, using the following payload:
    	http://foo?&apos;-alert(1)-&apos;
or
	http://foo/?'-alert(1)-'
    
Verify the technique worked by right-clicking, selecting "Copy URL", and pasting the URL in the browser. Clicking the name above your comment should trigger an alert.

########### https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-javascript-template-literal-angle-brackets-single-double-quotes-backslash-backticks-escaped

Submit a random alphanumeric string in the search box, then use Burp Suite to intercept the search request and send it to Burp Repeater.
    
Observe that the random string has been reflected inside a JavaScript template string.
    
Replace your input with the following payload to execute JavaScript inside the template string: 
	${alert(1)}
    
Verify the technique worked by right clicking, selecting "Copy URL", and pasting the URL in the browser. When you load the page it should trigger an alert.
