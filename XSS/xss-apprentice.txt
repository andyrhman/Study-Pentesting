Break out of the img attribute by searching for:

Enter the following into the into the search box:
<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
    
Click "Search".

The value of the src attribute is invalid and throws an error. This triggers the onerror event handler, which then calls the alert() function. As a result, the payload is executed whenever the user's browser attempts to load the page containing your malicious post.

This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability on the home page. It uses jQuery's $() selector function 
to auto-scroll to a given post, whose title is passed via the location.hash property. 

Notice the vulnerable code on the home page using Burp or the browser's DevTools.
    
From the lab banner, open the exploit server.

In the Body section, add the following malicious iframe:
    
<iframe src="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/#" onload="this.src+='<img src=x onerror=print()>'"></iframe>
or
<iframe src="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/#" onload="this.src+='<img src=x onerror=alert('xss')>'"></iframe>
    
Store the exploit, then click View exploit to confirm that the print() function is called.
    
Go back to the exploit server and click Deliver to victim to solve the lab.

Submit a random alphanumeric string in the search box, then use Burp Suite to intercept the search request 
and send it to Burp Repeater.
    
Observe that the random string has been reflected inside a quoted attribute.

Replace your input with the following payload to escape the quoted attribute and inject an event handler:
"onmouseover="alert(1)
    
Verify the technique worked by right-clicking, selecting "Copy URL", and pasting the URL in the browser. 
When you move the mouse over the injected element it should trigger an alert.

########### https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-href-attribute-double-quotes-html-encoded

Post a comment with a random alphanumeric string in the "Website" input, then use Burp Suite to intercept the request and send it to Burp Repeater.
    
Make a second request in the browser to view the post and use Burp Suite to intercept the request and send it to Burp Repeater.
    
Observe that the random string in the second Repeater tab has been reflected inside an anchor href attribute.

Repeat the process again but this time replace your input with the following payload to inject a JavaScript URL that calls alert:
javascript:alert(1)
    
Verify the technique worked by right-clicking, selecting "Copy URL", and pasting the URL in the browser. 
Clicking the name above your comment should trigger an alert.

########### https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-javascript-string-angle-brackets-html-encoded

Submit a random alphanumeric string in the search box, then use Burp Suite to intercept the search request 
and send it to Burp Repeater.
    
Observe that the random string has been reflected inside a JavaScript string.

Replace your input with the following payload to break out of the JavaScript string and inject an alert:
'-alert(1)-'
    
Verify the technique worked by right clicking, selecting "Copy URL", and pasting the URL in the browser. 
When you load the page it should trigger an alert.
