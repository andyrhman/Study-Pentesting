Open Burp's browser and log in to your account. Submit the "Update email" form, 
and find the resulting request in your Proxy history.

Send the request to Burp Repeater and observe that if you change the value of the csrf parameter 
then the request is rejected.

Use "Change request method" on the context menu to convert it into a GET request and observe that 
the CSRF token is no longer verified.

Open Burp's browser and log in to your account. Submit the "Update email" form, 
and find the resulting request in your Proxy history.

Send the request to Burp Repeater and observe that if you change the value 
of the csrf parameter then the request is rejected.

Delete the csrf parameter entirely and observe that the request is now accepted.

Make 2 Accounts, use your first account for csrf token it is important that you don't use it.

Use your another account for testing the csrf token vulnerabilitiy.

Observe that if you swap the CSRF token with the value from the other account, then the request is accepted. 

########### https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/bypassing-token-validation/lab-token-tied-to-non-session-cookie

Make 2 Accounts, use your first account for csrf token it is important that you don't use it.

Use your another account for testing the csrf token vulnerabilitiy.

Send the request to Burp Repeater and observe that changing the session cookie logs you out, 
but changing the csrfKey cookie merely results in the CSRF token being rejected. This suggests that the csrfKey cookie may not be strictly tied to the session.

Open a private/incognito browser window, log in to your other account, and send a fresh update email request into Burp Repeater.

Observe that if you swap the csrfKey cookie and csrf parameter from the first account to the second account, the request is accepted. 

Remove the auto-submit <script> block, and instead add the following code to inject the cookie:
<img src="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?search=test%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20csrfKey=YOUR-KEY%3b%20SameSite=None" onerror="document.forms[0].submit()">

Store the exploit, then click "Deliver to victim" to solve the lab.

Open Burp's browser and log in to your account. Submit the "Update email" form, 
and find the resulting request in your Proxy history.

Send the request to Burp Repeater and observe that the value of the csrf body parameter 
is simply being validated by comparing it with the csrf cookie.

Perform a search, send the resulting request to Burp Repeater, and observe that the search term gets reflected 
in the Set-Cookie header. Since the search function has no CSRF protection, you can use this to inject cookies into the victim user's browser.
