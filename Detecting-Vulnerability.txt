User-supplied input refers to any data or information that is provided by a user and used by a computer program. 
This can include data entered into a form, selected from a drop-down menu, or passed as a parameter in a URL. 
User-supplied input is often used to customize or personalize the behavior of a program, or to retrieve specific data from a database. 
However, if the input is not properly validated and sanitized, it can be used to introduce malicious code or commands into a program, 
which can lead to security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or Operating System Command Injection (OSCI).
