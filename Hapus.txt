To delete httpx from Kali Linux, you can use the apt-get package manager. First, update the package list by running the command apt-get update. Then, run the following command to remove httpx:

apt-get remove httpx

This will remove the httpx package, but leave any configuration files that were created during installation in place. If you want to remove these as well, you can use the purge option like this:

apt-get purge httpx

This will remove the package and all associated configuration files.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
