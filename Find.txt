To find the directories of projectdiscovery/httpx in Kali Linux, 
you can use the find command and search for directories that contain the httpx executable file.

For example, to search for directories containing httpx under the root directory (/),
 you can type the following command in a terminal window and press Enter:

find / -type d -executable -name httpx

This will search for directories that contain an executable file named httpx 
and output the full paths to those directories.

If you want to search for directories containing httpx under a specific directory,
you can specify the directory path in place of /. For example:

find /path/to/directory -type d -executable -name httpx

Replace /path/to/directory with the actual path to the directory you want to search.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
