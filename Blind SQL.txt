Visit the front page of the shop, and use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request containing the TrackingId cookie. 
For simplicity, let's say the original value of the cookie is TrackingId=xyz.

Modify the TrackingId cookie, changing it to:
TrackingId=xyz' AND '1'='1

Verify that the "Welcome back" message appears in the response.

Now change it to:
TrackingId=xyz' AND '1'='2

Verify that the "Welcome back" message does not appear in the response. 
This demonstrates how you can test a single boolean condition and infer the result.

Visit the front page of the shop, and use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request containing the TrackingId cookie.
For simplicity, let's say the original value of the cookie is TrackingId=xyz.

Modify the TrackingId cookie, appending a single quotation mark to it:
TrackingId=xyz'

Verify that an error message is received.
Now change it to two quotation marks:
TrackingId=xyz''
Verify that the error disappears. This suggests that a syntax error (in this case, the unclosed quotation mark)
is having a detectable effect on the response.

Visit the front page of the shop, and use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request containing the TrackingId cookie.

Modify the TrackingId cookie, changing it to:
TrackingId=x'||pg_sleep(10)--
Submit the request and observe that the application takes 10 seconds to respond.
